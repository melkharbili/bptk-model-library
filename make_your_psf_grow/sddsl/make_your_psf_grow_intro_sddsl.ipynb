In order to meet these challenges, a professional service firm must hire and retain highly skilled individuals, the firm's talents.

    "A good place to start to answer this questions for PSFs is the definition given by Maister: it is clear that the PSF needs customers, which are typically referred to as clients in this industry, and the PSF delivery consulting services to these clients. Depending on the type of PSF (e.g.IT services or strategy consulting) these services will be delivered in different ways, e.g. in IT services the ratio of face time work with the client to back office work working on an IT system will be different to that of a strategy consulting firm where most of the work is done face-to-face with the customer. At a specific PSF you will often find that you have different delivery channels according to client segments (or even individual clients), in which case you would need to add a party for each client segment with an individual delivery channel for each. Because we are dealing with a generic situation here it is enough to add a delivery channel to the diagram."

To maintain scalability PSFs often work with freelance consulants (especially in the IT services industry), so these recruiting agencies may supply both full-time and freelance talents."

We therefore add these to our value network and add a sales information channel (again bearing in mind that for a specific PSF there may be multiple groups of business contacts that are managed via corresponding channels)."

Naturally it makes a big difference if you are managing many transactions or few transactions. For instance, one of our clients provides a fully automated tolling service - they perform millions of transactions a week. Each individual transaction generates only very little value, but all together the value generated adds up to billions of euros per year. Another client of ours provides engineering services for power plants - the transactions they perform sometimes take more than ten years to complete, and they only perform a few of these in parallel."
