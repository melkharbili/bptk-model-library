  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "- You are not only competing for customers but also for human resources, i.e. the professionals you need to deliver your service. When market conditions are good for selling services, they are often bad for hiring professionals, because all your competitors are also trying to recruit fresh talent. This is why professional service firms are much less scalable then firms that create consumer goods or firms that provide online services.\n",
    "- When you bring new professionals on board, it takes a while for them to learn about how you go about your business. Not only are they not productive themselves, they also bring down the productivity of the experience professionals who are showing them the ropes.\n",
    "- You need these professionals both to acquire new business (e.g. for service development effort and pre-sales bidding effort that is not billable) and also to deliver the associated service. If you don't do this well, you can easily end up with an oscillating business where you first have to much business, but to few professional resources, then you have to little business and to many resources and so on."

    "Let me start with how the professional service firm (PSF) makes money. To keep our discussion simple I assume the PSF delivers its service in the form of projects. The projects are billed regularly (e.g. weekly). The revenue is then calculated as the project delivery rate (measured in staff weeks per week) times the weekly project delivery fee (which I assume is identical for each staff member). The project delivery rate itself will depend on how many staff members are working on projects, the volume of the projects (measured in staff weeks) and the duration of the projects (measured in calendar weeks). These factors determine the PSFs revenue, I've illustrated them in the causal loop diagram below."

I've added these connections to the diagram below."

Clearly the rate at which the staff can deliver projects doesn't only depend on the number of staff available, but also on the number of current projects. The faster the projects are delivered, the faster the current number of projects goes down - if no new projects come in, the PSF will go ot ouf business.

    "Well, obviously the professional service staff can't just spend its time delivering projects, it also needs to spend some of its time acquiring new projects. The number of business development staff will determine the rate at which new business is developed, along with the effort to find prospective customers and with the prospecting success. The result of business development efforts are proposals, some of which are successful, some of which are not. Experience also shows that there is mostly a significant delay between generating a lead, writing a proposal and the time the new assignment starts. It is important to note that although these factors can be influenced by the company (after all, that is what marketing is all about), they are mainly determined by the market you are operating in."

In other companies, some of the staff both develop business and deliver projects, sharing their time between the two tasks. I will investigate the implications of these strategies a little later in this chapter, for now it is sufficent to add these facts to the sketch."
